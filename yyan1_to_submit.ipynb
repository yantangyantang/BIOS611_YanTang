    "This topic was chosen because I enjoy riding bicycle a lot. However Chapel Hill seems to be more hilly and I usually visit Raleigh on weekend so this came up to my mind to find out whether it would be a good idea to do bike riding in Raleigh. As we would have assumed, when a crash occurs between a vehicle and a bike, it’s the cyclist who is most likely to be injured. Therefore, it’s only natural to want to get a clearer picture on facts about bicycle safety in Raleigh before putting action into it. Also I’m curious about the possible correlation between sun glares and the likelihood of cyclist crash occurrence."
